## What is this?

My first take at procedural generation from a seed.

An integer seed is split into parts, each used to generate the different properties of the planet: size, distance, type etc... and further seeds are generated for the other layers of the system (moons in this case) simple technique but quite effective.

Play around generating systems and if you fall in love with any of them, save the url to rebuild it later.
